## Web Application

### Prerequisites
You can check the preqrequistes in the `VITask Web/requirements.txt` file. You require `Python 3.2 or higher` and make sure `pip` and `python` are added in `PATH` variable successfully before running.

### Installation

1.Creating Virtual Environment and activating:
* Open cmd

* Change current directory to VITask Web. Using command `cd "VITask Web"`
* Run this `py -3 -m venv venv` or `python3 -m venv venv` or if you have `virtualenv` set up use command `virtulalenv venv`.
* To activate virtual environment, run this `venv\Scripts\activate` or if you are using bash terminal `source venv/Scripts/activate`
* Now install `requirements.txt`
    
2.Installing from `requirements.txt`:
* Activate virtual environment as told above.
* Run this `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     
3.Next step is running `main.py` . But before do following steps.

* For Windows users, authorize Firebase by saving `firebase.json` in a suitable location and then executing `set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = path_to_your_firebase.json\firebase.json` in cmd.
* For Linux Users, Authorize Firebase by saving `firebase.json` in a suitable location and then executing `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = path_to_your_firebase.json\firebase.json` in terminal.
    
4.Running `main.py`

* Activate virtual environment and then make sure you have completed above steps.
* Now run `py main.py` or `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` or `py3 main.py`
* Open your Browser and then enter URL `http://localhost:5000/login` to enter your login details
* Now Check the `main.py` for the `@app.route` and then head over to the page you want to check for example if you want to check page `xyz`    then it will have an app route as `@app.route('/xyz')`.Then use the URL `http://localhost:5000/xyz`
